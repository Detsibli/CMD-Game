# CMD-Game
A game made in C++ using Linked Lists.

This is a game I created during my Associate's studies at South Texas College.
The goal of the project was to use Linked Lists in any way, shape or form.
I decided to create a text based game, from which I added saving, a primitive UI and so forth.
While most of the code can be refactored to be more efficient and simpler, take in account this was early during my Computer Science studies.

To play the game you can download the game.exe file or run the code in a C++ compiler

I have plans to remake this in C#.
